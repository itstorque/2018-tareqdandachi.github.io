    <h3 class="pretitle">Project for CBS — 2019</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      I worked as a Java Developer Intern at CBS Lebanon over the summer of 2019. I also worked as a Freelance Brand and UI Designer for them where I got to rework lots of the brand, from redesigning the color pallete and logos to rebuilding their website from the ground up.

    <h3 class="pretitle">Assistive Technology MIT — 2018-2019</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      My passion for interdisciplinary technology and making a change got me to join the Assistive Technology group at MIT where I get to help plan lots of events and hackathons. I also employed my design skills to redesign the logo, website and work as an outreach personnel where I got to design merchandise (shirts, hats, etc.) and marketing resources (pamphlets and posters). Getting to work with the AT team to see hackers build awesome tech for Co-Designers from the community is one of my favorite things at MIT.

    <h3 class="work">
      I thank my curiosity for joining The Tech. I wouldn't have ever thought of working at a newspaper, but here I am! It's one of the most unique experiences, being able to get together with people from so many different backgrounds and help implement features that easen their jobs while writing articles in the CMS. My job at The Tech helped me build essential skills in studying user workflows to enhance their experience. I also love maintaining the website where most people around campus get their information from.

    <h3 class="pretitle">FlipLearn — 2018</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      FlipLearn was one of my favorite cross-platform* apps to build. It was centered around converting any school into a digital learning school (without any infrastructure changes), where teachers, students, parents and admins all used the same platform to communicate, check attendance, create quizzes, share the teacher's whiteboard and literally everything else. From buying food from the cafeteria to scanning quizzes and having them corrected automatically, FlipLearn does everything a school needs! One of my favorite things about the platform was working on inclusive UI for all ages and implementing AI throughout to perform complex functions that make teachers jobs way easier.
    </h3>

    <h3 class="note">the platform included a web-app for everyone, an iPad App for Students and both an Android and an iOS app for Teachers and Parents.</h3>

    <h3 class="pretitle">Augmented Reality and Education - 2019</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      While exploring the idea of integrating technology with learning, I found myself stumbling across AR (Augmented Reality), helping me merge the physical world and the learning experience without having the limitations of doing so. One of my projects was a space exploration app which used 3D models based on information gathered from NASA to help kids of all ages<span style="user-select: none;"> <span style="text-decoration: line-through; color: red;">study</span></span> <span style="color: green">learn while exploring</span> planets, galaxies and the cosmos. The app featured a kid friendly game-like UI and relied heavily on integrating scientifically accurate 3D models into the real world through the camera.

    <h3 class="pretitle">Multi-Purpose Assistive Glasses - 2018</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      Winning the first place award in the innovation competition at the American University of Sharjah in 2018, these glasses function as a cost-effective* device that helps people who live with disabilities. The glasses perform 2 major functions:
      <ol>
        <li>Uses an IR camera to track the motion of pupils to move a cursor on a computer or control a robot. Meant to help patients with MS, ALS or any Motor Neuron Disease.</li>
        <li>Restores hearing to deaf people.</li>
      </ol>
    </h3>

    <h3 class="note">All of the included technology (excluding the glasses frame) cost less than $6 to build.</h3>

    <h3 class="pretitle">Vestibular Migraine Auditory Suppressant (VMAS) - 2018</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      VMAS is an EEG (electroencephalography) technique where the electrodes are hidden inside a beanie to track the activity in certain regions of the brain associated with vestibular migraines. Using machine learning to predict the occurence of a vestibular migraine up to 10 minutes before it actually occurs, it informs the wearer with an LED notification to rest so that the migraine doesn't worsen. It doesn't stop there, VMAS also uses bone conduction to transmit binaural white noise to stimulate theta neural oscillations (brainwaves that are associated with calming) in the brain and moderate the hyper-active regions and prevent the migraine from occuring.

    <h3 class="pretitle">Unintrusive Bionic Arm — 2017-2018</h3>

    <h3 class="work">
      An EEG equiped robot arm that uses machine learning to predict when neurons are firing and move the fingers accordingly. The arm also has "reflexes" built into it; where the arm would naturally respond to surroundings even if the neurons fail to fire. Examples include trying to catch a ball, clenching a hand while handshaking and adjusting grip while lifting objects. All of this is driven by the 14 sensors (Ultra-Sonic Sensors, Gyroscopes and Infra-Red Cameras) in the arm and an AI that decides what the environment is. The arm is also equipped with extra features that may be deemed useful, such as a super-bright flashlight and room mapping to aid the blind. The highlight of the arm is it requires no operation to be used, it's more like a piece of clothing than a medical device.
